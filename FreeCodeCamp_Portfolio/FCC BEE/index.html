                <p>This guide covers just about everything a beginning beekeeper needs, apart from patience, courage and
                    bees. There's a lot of stuff here, but you should already know what it all is, and what it's for.
                    We've recommended things that seem to work best for us, but in many cases there isn't a 'best'
                    answer. If you want to do things differently, that's fine. Different doesn't mean wrong. </p>
                <p>The cost of beekeeping can be considerable and be sure to factor in the cost of regularly
                    replacing/adding equipment, joining an Association, books, insurance, training and, of course, your
                    bees which is dealt with under the Buying Bees section. The prices quoted are based broadly on the
                    Thorne's catalogue, with VAT included, at standard rates in 2012. We have listed other suppliers on
                    our links page so do shop around as prices vary hugel.</p>

                    alt="beekeeper veil">
                    <p><b>Veil</b>. You need at least a veil, they come in various styles, but are cheap. Most
                        beekeepers like to have a smock (a jacket with built-in veil) or a bee-suit (a full-length
                        overall with a built-in veil). If you like lots of pockets, or are nervous, a bee-suit is
                        recommended, but a smock is fine with trousers. If you get a smock, try to find one with a
                        draw-string waist. Elastic waists are fine if you are the right shape, but sadly many of us
                        aren't. Costs range from about $30 for a veil and up to $200 for a suit.</p>

                        alt="beekeeper gloves">
                        <p><b>Gloves</b>. For normal operations, bare hands are adequate, provided you wash your hands
                            between hives, but latex or nitrile disposable gloves (surgical, or decorators' gloves) are
                            preferred by many. If you use these, make sure you get the 'unpowdered' ones. Although only
                            are a few people are allergic to the powder, you don't want it in your honey. Leather
                            gauntlets look pretty but they get spoilt with propolis very quickly making handling your
                            frames much harder. They are almost impossible to wash thereby making them unhygienic and
                            impractical as the beekeeper must have clean gloves every time they visit a colony or
                            different apiary. Disposable gloves cost about $12 per box of 100. Rubber gloves with cotton
                            gauntlets cost about $30 and leather gloves about $50 a pair.</p>

                            <p><b>Boots</b>. Many beekeepers wear Wellingtons or galoshes (short rubber boots that
                                caterers and food processors wear) to stop bees crawling into shoes or up trouser legs.
                                They come in all prices, from about $30 upwards.

                <header>
                    <h2>Equipment</h2>
                </header>
                <p><b>Smoker</b>. Buy a good one. Stainless steel is good, and the bigger is usually better - however,
                    small ones can be just as effective, and if they have a plastic knob on the lid, you'll be able to
                    refuel them between hives without burning your fingers. Make sure to buy a smoker with bellows that
                    can be replaced and a cage around the body to reduce the risk of accidents. £40-£50 will get you a
                    very good smoker.​</p>
                <p><b>Fuel</b>. You can use just about anything that burns. Dry rotten wood, cardboard, sacking, dry
                    leaves or egg boxes. You can buy some of these fuels, or you can find them. Whatever you use, make
                    sure it doesn't have fire-retardants in (most sacking and cardboard do contain fire-retardants), or
                    insecticides. You can get smoke pellets then are slow and long burning. You want a cool smoke that
                    doesn't smell too bad.
                </p>
                <p><b>Hive tool</b>. Buy a stainless steel one. The most common are the 'J' shape tools, but others are
                    available. Buy a big one if you can, as you'll need to use it to lever boxes apart, and the bigger
                    the tool, the easier it is to use. Perhaps buy two. These cost about £10 - £15.</p>
                <p><b>Plastic Tub</b>. An old ice-cream tub will do at a pinch, but old food buckets that caterers get
                    their cooking oil or mayonnaise in are good, too. It must be big enough to hold your hive tool, and
                    have a lid that fits well.</p>
                <p><b>Kitchen Scourer</b>. For cleaning your hive tool. One of those little round metal scourers is fine
                    - just the scourer, not a brillo pad or anything with soap in it, as that will annoy the bees.</p>
                <p><b>Washing Soda</b>. This comes in little bags of crystals that you add to water in your tub or
                    bucket. Then you'll have a good place to keep your (stainless steel) hive tool and your scourer, so
                    you can clean the hive tool between hives. About £1 per bag.</p>
                <p><b>Feeder</b>. There are lots of types of feeder. Some take a couple of gallons of syrup, others take
                    a couple of litres. A small, 'rapid' feeder, usually round and made of white plastic, is best to
                    begin with. About £10.</p>
                <p><b>Queen Marking Cage</b>. You will need to mark the queen at some stage. Even if you start with a
                    nucleus or swarm with a marked queen, get a marking cage so you can practice marking drones. The
                    most common type is a 'Baldock' cage and is about £5.</p>
                <p><b>Queen Marking Pen</b>. Get a Queen Marking Pen in the right colour for the year (see your textbook
                    for which colour). They're quite expensive, but useful if you run more than one hive, or like to do
                    things properly. Marking pens are about £4.50 each.</p>
                <p><b>Notebook</b>. Or at least some means of keeping records. You can buy templates and some use
                    computer programmes or Apps. You are required by law to keep a note of treatments you administer to
                    your bees especially if you sell honey. From day one, keep a notebook. Write in it what you've done
                    and what you've seen every time you look at the bees or do anything in the apiary. Some BBKA Modules
                    need evidence of two years record keeping.</p>
                <p>The list of other equipment you need could be endless but it would be wise to have a Porter Bee
                    Escape to clear bees from supers and they often break so have several; a queen cage for the
                    introduction of a new Queen; a clip Queen; a small upholsterers hammer for making frames; a
                    blowtorch for scorching out woodwork; gimp pins for making and repairing frames; drawing pins for
                    marking frames (always keep some pinned in the roof of your hive) and a mouseguard.</p>
                <p>Other equipment (e.g. extractors), and consumables (e.g medicines, jars, lids and labels), are things
                    you probably won't need to worry about in your first year. The LBKA can lend you an extractor, and
                    you can usually borrow some of the other things from fellow beekeepers if you ask nicely. Because
                    you won't know what, or how much of anything, you'll need until much later, there's no point in
                    thinking about these things yet.</p>
                <p>Finally, the most important piece of equipment in the first year is the telephone, and we're assuming
                    you've got one already. Don't be afraid to contact other beekeepers if you have problems. You will,
                    without hardly noticing it, accumulate a lot of gear so be aware that you need good storage.</p>

                    <h2>The Hive</h2>
                </header>
                <p>Although a hive looks like a box made of wood, it's a bit more complicated than that. It is possible
                    to make a hive yourself. Plans are available very cheaply, and if you have woodworking equipment and
                    skills, it's a fun project. If you haven't, it's not, and you'd be better off buying a hive.</p>
                <p>Hives are available in flat-pack form, or ready-made. Flat-pack hives need putting together, which
                    isn't always easy the first time, but are much cheaper. If you're not sure, get a flat-pack, have a
                    look at it, but don't use any glue until you're sure which way round it all goes. If it still
                    baffles, take it along to an association meeting, and somebody will help you put it together.</p>
                <p>The best wood for hives is Western Red Cedar (WRC), though it is expensive. If you are starting from
                    scratch, then you need, at the bare minimum:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A hive stand</li>
                    <li>1 Floor with a mesh, not solid, floor</li>
                    <li>1 Brood Box</li>
                    <li>12 Brood frames (Hoffman self spacing is preferable) with foundation</li>
                    <li>1 Queen Excluder</li>
                    <li>2 Supers</li>
                    <li>24 super Frames with foundation</li>
                    <li>1 Crownboard</li>
                    <li>1 Roof</li>
                    <p>There are lots of types of hive. If you are keeping bees in London, we recommend you use a 14 x
                        12 hive. All parts for this hive are interchangeable with a National Hive which is considered to
                        be too small a space to keep a colony in London. You can spend anything from £250 - £550 for a
                        basic hive which can be bought either flat packed or fully assembled.</p>
                    <p>You will need a spare brood box, too. In London, one of our main problems is swarming, and
                        artificial swarming is a good tool for controlling swarming, as well as for disease control. To
                        do an artificial swarm you need, at the minimum, two brood boxes.</p>
                    <p><b>Foundation</b>. Buy wired foundation for both brood and super frames, unless you are going to
                        make cut comb, Unwired extra-thin foundation is used for preparing cut comb honey, but it can't
                        be used in an extractor. Wired foundation is strong enough to cope with being spun. Although you
                        are not going to be putting brood frames in an extractor, the brood frames can get very heavy in
                        the hive, and the extra strength is useful insurance.</p>
                    <p><b>Polystyrene Hives</b>. The jury is out on this relatively new type of hive. They are certainly
                        cheaper and lighter and some claim they keep the bees cool in the summer and warm in the winter.
                        They can prove to be a false economy because the polystyrene, however robust at first, suffers
                        as the keeper uses a hive tool to manage his bees and bits can become dislodged or gouged. It is
                        good practice to scorch wooden parts at the beginning of a season but this is not possible with
                        polystyrene and beginners who start out with these hives often revert to the more traditional
                        wooden hive. But see what suits you.</p>
                    <p>As a beginner, we strongly recommend you buy new equipment if you can afford it and, if you
                        can't, wait until you can, or make it yourself. Good second-hand equipment is difficult to find,
                        and often needs mending and will certainly need very thorough cleaning. Second hand equipment
                        can carry disease. All the inside woodwork (the insides of boxes and both sides of crownboards
                        and queen excluders) should be thoroughly scorched (play the flame over the surface till it's
                        slightly darkened) to sterilise them. Small equipment, such as queen marking cages and bee
                        escapes should always be bought new. If you do make any equipment yourself, use wood that hasn't
                        been treated with insecticides. You can sometimes tell by looking ('tanalized' wood, which is
                        pressure treated with chemicals, including arsenic, sometimes has a greenish stain to it), but
                        it's not always easy to spot.</p>

                    <h2>Pests</h2>
                </header>
                <p>There are many pests and diseases that affects bees.</p>
                <p>The most widespread problem for the Western Honey bee is the <b>varoa mite</b>. While they don't
                    actually kill bees themselves, they spread diseases such as <b>"deformed wing virus"</b> which can
                    kill the entire colony. Accidentally introduced from Asia, they are now endemic in our colonies.
                    Unlike the Asian Honey Bee, the Western Honey Bee (that European beekeepers keep) cannot deal with
                    these easily and most colonies will die without intervention. Beekeepers use a combination of colony
                    management techniques and treatment to control these mites.</p>

                        <p>Regional (government-employed) Bee Inspectors help ensure that serious diseases such as
                            American Foul Brood and European Foul Brood (a notifiable diseases) are kept under control
